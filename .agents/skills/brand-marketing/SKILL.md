# Brand Marketing Animation

Apply Disney's 12 animation principles to commercials, advertisements, brand identity, and marketing content.

## Quick Reference

| Principle | Brand/Marketing Implementation |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Squash & Stretch | Product bounce, logo elasticity |
| Anticipation | Build-up to reveal, suspense |
| Staging | Product hero shots, focal control |
| Straight Ahead / Pose to Pose | Story flow vs key moments |
| Follow Through / Overlapping | Logo elements settle, tagline delay |
| Slow In / Slow Out | Dramatic reveals, smooth motion |
| Arc | Sweeping camera, product arcs |
| Secondary Action | Environment responds to product |
| Timing | Match brand energy, music sync |
| Exaggeration | Brand personality amplification |
| Solid Drawing | Consistent brand identity in motion |
| Appeal | Memorable, emotionally resonant |

## Principle Applications

**Squash & Stretch**: Products can bounce on landing for energy. Logo elements stretch during reveals. Text can have elastic emphasis. Match brand personality—luxury minimal, playful bouncy.

**Anticipation**: Build suspense before product reveal. Pause before tagline appears. Sound design wind-up precedes visual payoff. Create expectation, then deliver.

**Staging**: Product is always the hero. Lighting directs to focal point. Background supports, never competes. Clear visual hierarchy every frame.

**Straight Ahead vs Pose to Pose**: Story-driven commercials flow naturally (straight ahead energy). Key reveal moments are precisely posed. Blend both—flow to moments of impact.

**Follow Through & Overlapping**: Logo elements settle at different rates. Tagline appears after logo lands. Product features animate in sequence. Creates natural, alive feeling.

**Slow In / Slow Out**: Dramatic reveals use long ease-in. Impact moments snap. Premium brands use slower, more deliberate timing. Energetic brands use faster, snappier easing.

**Arc**: Camera movements sweep in arcs. Products tumble naturally. Logo elements flow, don't snap. Text can follow curved paths for dynamism.

**Secondary Action**: Environment responds to product presence. Particles, light rays, reflections. Music and motion sync. Every element reinforces the message.

**Timing**: Match brand energy profile. Luxury: slow, deliberate (500-800ms). Tech: precise, efficient (200-400ms). Playful: bouncy, energetic (300-500ms with overshoot). Sync to music beats.

**Exaggeration**: Amplify brand personality traits. Confident brands use bold, decisive motion. Friendly brands use rounded, bouncy motion. Exaggeration makes brand memorable.

**Solid Drawing**: Logo maintains integrity in motion. Brand colors consistent throughout. Typography respects brand guidelines. Motion style matches brand identity system.

**Appeal**: Animation should evoke target emotion. Trust, excitement, comfort, aspiration. Every motion choice serves brand message. Memorable moments people want to rewatch.

## Brand Personality Motion

### Luxury/Premium
```
- Slow, deliberate timing (500-800ms)
- Minimal motion, maximum impact
- Subtle easing, no bounce
- Clean, geometric paths
- Restrained color transitions
```

### Tech/Innovation
```
- Precise, efficient timing (200-400ms)
- Sharp, decisive motion
- Geometric transitions
- Light trails, particle systems
- Data-driven motion graphics
```

### Playful/Friendly
```
- Bouncy timing with overshoot (300-500ms)
- Squash and stretch throughout
- Curved, organic paths
- Bright color pops
- Character-driven elements
```

### Professional/Corporate
```
- Balanced timing (300-500ms)
- Clean, purposeful motion
- Grid-aligned movements
- Fade and slide transitions
- Subtle, refined effects
```

## Logo Animation Framework

| Phase | Duration | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Anticipation | 200-400ms | Build expectation |
| Reveal | 400-800ms | Main animation |
| Settle | 200-400ms | Follow-through |
| Hold | 1000-2000ms | Brand recognition |

### Logo Reveal Patterns
1. **Build-up**: Elements assemble into logo
2. **Reveal**: Mask or transition exposes logo
3. **Transform**: Abstract shape morphs to logo
4. **Kinetic**: Logo elements in motion, then resolve

## Music Sync Guidelines

- Major beats: key reveals, impacts
- Measures: section transitions
- BPM: drives overall energy
- Silence: powerful before reveal
- Sound design: reinforces motion

## Platform Timing

| Platform | Max Length | Logo Hold |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| TV Commercial | 15/30/60s | 2-3s |
| Pre-roll | 6/15s | 1-2s |
| Social video | 15-60s | 1.5-2s |
| Stories | 15s | 1-1.5s |
| Bumper | 6s | 1s |
